I never thought I could came across the pain I suffered from several years ago again. Of course, everything originates from my inner personality. I can handle with the relationship with nothing close to me. I can't withstand myself. I need to say sorry, for my friends, also myself. Someday I found all my relationship with my friends are based on ingratiating myself with them.
